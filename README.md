# RhythmDice
A random rhythm generator to practice music reading.

abcjs-midi.css and abcjs_midi_5.6.7-min.js are taken from https://github.com/paulrosen/abcjs (MIT license).

Their recent [Configurator](https://configurator.abcjs.net/) has proved very helpful in writing the javascript code for this project.
